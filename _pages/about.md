Hello! 

I am a PhD Candidate at [Institute of Computing](https://ic.unicamp.br/), University of Campinas, Brazil in the [Laboratory of Optimization and Combinatorics (LOCo)](https://loco.ic.unicamp.br/) under the supervision of Orlando Lee.

Currently, I am an intern at Centre Inria d'Université Côte d'Azur, team [COATI](https://team.inria.fr/coati/presentation/) under the supervision of Frédéric Havet.

I am interested in combinatorics and algorithms, particularly in graph theory.
